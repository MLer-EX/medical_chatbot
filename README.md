# Medical Chatbot with AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a high-precision medical chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The chatbot is designed to provide medical consultation and guidance based on user inputs. By leveraging advanced AI models, we aim to create a system that can simulate interactions with a medical professional and provide accurate responses to medical-related queries.

## Key Features

- **AI-powered Medical Consultation**: The chatbot uses state-of-the-art AI models to analyze and respond to user messages with medical advice.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries in natural language and providing responses accordingly.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface allows users to interact with the chatbot, making the experience seamless.
- **Customizable Models**: You can choose between different AI models depending on your needs and available resources.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 (or custom models like `gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS for basic form inputs and message display
- **Database**: SQLite (default, but configurable to other databases)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-chatbot.git
    cd medical-chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the `.env` file for your OpenAI API key:


    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    

4. Run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/chat/` to interact with the chatbot.

### Usage

- **Chat**: Enter a medical-related question, and the chatbot will provide a response based on AI-powered analysis.
- **Logs**: User messages and chatbot responses are logged in the database for further analysis and improvement.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved AI models**: Further integration with specialized medical AI models for more accurate consultations.
- **Multi-language Support**: Adding support for additional languages beyond the current implementation.
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile-friendly version of the chatbot.
